  <h1 class="blogTitle">First Few Days in Hong Kong</h1>
  <p class="blogBody">
    It has been a grueling few days in Hong Kong, but it has also completely blown my mind so far. The flights I took to get to Hong Kong were pretty brutal, and
    I didn't more than an hour of consecutive sleep over those 2-3 days. Once there I faced the full brunt of the humidity, heat, and hills here while also carrying around approximately 80lbs of luggage and my backpack, in attempt to move in to my hall.

  <p class="blogBody">All that said, I have seen some of the most beaufitul views I have ever seen - I am amazed every day by the views I see all around me.
    Friday was orientation and my first time walking around campus. The campus is no Notre Dame that's for sure. Notre Dame can be laid out so neatly on a map,
    whereas HKU is essentially on the slope of Victoria's Peak - meaning there are a lot of stairs & escalators and winding pathways into different buildings - something I have come to find is very hard to emulate on a map.

  <p class="blogBody">Plenty more where that came from, but it will come in a different post. Keep coming back for more updates!
