     School started back up again so I don't have much to update on. I have done a few things over the past few weeks so I guess I'll share that stuff.

  I went on a bus tour around the island I live on. We went to a small beach for a little bit (no swimming yet, not quite the season), and we also took a ferry around the harbor in Aberdeen. It was a fun bus ride with a lot of cool sights to see. We went and got sushi afterward and I was happier than I probably should have been, I had been craving though and it was just so perfect. A good way to get me out of my room on a Sunday afternoon.

  <p class="blogBody">I also started going to the HKU rugby practices! The team is full of great people - as expected, Women's Rugby just has the best people. I'm grateful they've welcomed me and help me whenever I look lost. I don't have any pictures yet from practice but I do have a video of some of the STAIRS I need to climb whenever I walk back to my flat from practice. It's brutal.

    I also unfortunately recently pulled my first all-nighter. After rugby practice I went to a karaoke room with some other exchange students and we really just sang the night away. I didn't get back to my room until 7:00am, and then I went straight to sleep. I felt surprisingly ok for most of the night, but I hope to never do that again. We got McDonald's at 5am and it was glorious. Quite the adventure!

     That's all I have for any updates. Shoutout to CJ, Angela, Kayla, Jozef, and Bui for the wonderful notes they wrote me in the card CJ arranged. I'm very lucky I have such wonderful people to miss back in the US. Shoutout to Meghan too because she will be offended if I don't shout her out, but she's also just great and deserves recognition for all her hard work in Nursing School - I'm very proud of her and am constantly amazed by her.
