     I have finally completed my semester abroad and am now back in the US as of writing this last blog post. I'll talk about how May was and maybe some concluding thoughts.   
  </p>

  <p class="blogBody">
  First, of course, I will get the food pics out of the way.

   I did not have much time to do anything too crazy in May. I had finals to study for and the weather was rainy on a lot of my free days. I still tried to go out and explore in small ways - try new foods, go on long walks, etc. These simple things make me very happy.

    I went to see Beauty and the Beast with a live orchestra and singers. I went alone and made a whole night of it - took myself to dinner, went out to the movie concert, and got some ice cream afterwards. It was a great date I took myself out on. It was so much fun though, hearing the live orchestral score and songs brought a giant smile to my face while I was watching. It was a very nice night.

    Finals always stress me out, but I took them, and they're done. Finals season instead of being all in one week like I'm used to was spread out over the month of May. I loved that i had more time to study but it felt like I had less time to enjoy myself and that my suffering was being prolonged. Nonetheless, I survived.

   Now, I am back in the US. I have a lot of thoughts about the Spring semester and Hong Kong. I did things I never thought I would do, and saw things I neever thought I would see, as clich√© as that is. If you're curious about more specifics of my experience, I would be happy to talk about them, just contact me - if you are reading this website you likely have some method of getting in touch with me. With that said, I have one more thing to say about Hong Kong that I didn't write about much.
   The people there were amazing. From the man who helped me with directions on how to get to my flat in my first hours there, to the two wonderful ladies who served me ramen every week, everyone there was so polite and helpful. I am forever grateful to their kindness and patience - it made going to a completely unfamiliar country so much more special.
   That's all I have to say here, I just want to thank everybody who read all my posts and kept up with this website. I am no photographer or social media star, but it was nice to have this website to record the things 
I did here, and I am glad people actually read about what I did here! These posts were not quick to make, so I appreciate the feedback and love I got on this mini project I embarked on. I hope I can come again some day and have even more adventures.
