        <li>Get your visa sorted out as early as possible. Like 6 months in advanced. It'll somehow never be early
          enough to start getting things organized and sent in but you can at least try.</li>
          <li>Have comfortable walking shoes. There's so much walking and so many stairs here I'm dying.</li>
        <li>Don't succumb to the fatigue you get at 5pm. You will have to participate in a Spaghetti-Western-style showdown with death itself and you will only realize you lost when you wake up at 5am the next day.</li>
        <li>Be patient. You don't have to do something exciting every single day. Sometimes listening to a podcast and watching the sunset from a nearby park is all you need to enjoy your day.</li>
        <li>McDonald's at 5am after being up all night HITS. But also yeah don't stay up all night; it's not worth it. That wasn't something learned, rather it was something I recently experienced for the first time.</li>
        <li>Eating alone at a restaurant is a lovely experience, but I also don't know what to do when I'm eating. I usually wait until I get all my food, in case the staff needs to say something to me, take a quick picture of the food, and then I listen to my podcast and enjoy the food. </li>
        <li>Someone on the rugby team taught me how to properly use chopsticks for the first time in my life. Being a self-taught chopstick user has hindered my progress. It was funny trying to adjust. I could pick up small pieces of chicken, but have not yet graduated to noodles. Those are a bit more slippery and advanced for my current skill level.</li>
        <li>I learned how to properly pass in rugby. Technically a lesson learned even though I had played 3 seasons of it before this year. Passing was always my greatest weakness. It's improved a lot though!</li>
        <li>Home is where the grocery store you can wander around in is.</li>
        <li>I REALLY hate bugs.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to assert your right to leave a social event when your social battery has run well past being empty.</li>
      </ol>
