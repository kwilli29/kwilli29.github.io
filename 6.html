     This is a big post about all the fun activities I did in March - it was a pretty fun month and I'm glad I was able to make this fun title out the things I did.

  I did not do any travelling outside the country during Spring Break so I made sure I explored places around the island. I ended up visiting the Tai Tam Reservoir - a beautiful historical site with a nice walking path.

  <p class="blogBody"> I have also had some tasty Ramen at a small place near the HKU campus - Sakura house. I honestly think it is my favorite place to eat here. The two queens who run this place have my heart.

    This month I played in 2 rugby tournaments. I am no star player of the 7s rugby field, but the tournaments were still a fun chance to play in a game setting. I alos went to some of the Friday games of the Hong Kong 7s! That was a very fun night - it was raining and made the everything more slippery but all the games were very fun to wacth. Also... more egg pizza!!

      Finally - we made a trip to some rock pools. The day was filled with a lot of ups and downs. We missed the bus we needed to take to get to the path that lead to the rock pools, so we ended up on a 3hr hike to get to that path.  I enjoyed it, that's the kind of hiking I have been wanting to do. It was VERY muddy though, but also very beautiful.  We finished the hike, but had to walk different 30 min. (paved) path to get to the rock pools - that was also a nice walk, it lead through a village and past a beach.

    The rock pools were very fun. We made sure to stay safe - don't worry - nobody was jumping into the rock pool, but we did swim. The water was so clear and refreshing, I have never been in anything quite like it. I got to clean all the mud off of me from the hike. It was a long journey to get there - but it was definitely worth it. We had to almost run in order to catch the last bus back - that was kinda scary but we luckily made it with 3 minutes to spare. It was a great day, and did over 30,000 steps by the end of it. The rest of the night was kinda downhill but at the end of the day I went to bed and slept like a rock.
