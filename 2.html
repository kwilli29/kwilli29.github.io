  <h1 class="blogTitle"> More hills, More stairs... </h1>
  <p class="blogBody">
    I have been doing a lot of exploring this past week - both on the HKU campus and in the surrounding city. With that, has come some pleasants sights and adventures... and some not so pleasant. 
  </p>

  <p class="blogBody">The ND Alumni in HK arranged a dinner with the exchange students currently here and it was so much fun. The global network ND creates is insane. Afterwards I got some tatsy gelato and took a cool picture of the street - the Midwest certainly does not have this lively and colorful of a nightlife! 
    A few days later I walked back to Victoria Harbour to see the Symphony of Lights - it was really cool but honestly, I think seeing it from the other side would be cooler. I will have to go back later in the semester :P

  <p class="blogBody">I also went to the famous Jockey club to see the horse races last night. We missed getting off on the right bus stop both going there and coming back, oops. Still made it there. It's about the journey, not the destination. Horse racing isn't really my thing, but it was fun to get out and meet some people and see some funny horse names (like "Rising From the Ashes"). I had one of the most painfully awkward small-talk conversations of my life though (partly my fault) and you know, that's the price I pay for hating small talk - I am very bad at it. We got food though after and that was great - it was a very local place and I had some yummy noodles. I'm glad I went out, but I probably will not be going again.
  
  <p class="blogBody">I also had my first day of classes! I was nervous about the intensity of academics here but I don't think it'll be any more difficult than what I've experienced in <i>certain</i> classes at Notre Dame (*cough*Systems*cough*OS*cough*).

  <p class="blogBody">I would be lying if I said I didn't feel homesick, or that I didn't miss the familiarity of everything at Notre Dame.  It was a very big jump for me to go from never having left the country to a whole semester abroad in a completely unfamiliar country. I definitely have been feeling the weight of this choice over the past week, but I also can't help but hear a small voice inside me saying this is exactly what I needed to do. I am settling in a little more each day. Lunar New Year is next week, so I have some extra time to explore while everyone is with their families. I'll make sure to make some more updates!
